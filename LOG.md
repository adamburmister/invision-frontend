# Work Log

## Monday 10pm

- I've had a chat with Danielle today and have taken 20 minutes to review the content
  she's sent through - I understand the requirements, and am starting to work out a
  TOOD list of tasks required to implement the task.

- I've been wanting to learn a couple new technlogies recently: diving more into
  React, Alt.JS (Flux implementation), Reactive.JS (not related to React),
  and Falcor (Netflix's JSON Graph).
  
  Since I want a project to learn and test these new concepts on I think I will kill
  two birds with one stone... this will slow my submision down, but given (when I asked)
  there was no time restriction I think this should be ok (please forgive me otherwise).

## Tuesday 6pm

- The courier delivered my electric longboard today! (ridemarbel.com) I don't expect
  the evening to be overly productive ;)

- Talked to some React users about Flux implementations, am going to play with Redux
  rather than Alt now based on their recommendations.

- Writing the first HTML mockup, using BEM notation (not sure what you guys prefer,
  but can refactor later easily enough).
