# Work Log

## Monday 10pm

I've had a chat with Danielle today and have taken 20 minutes to review the content
she's sent through - I understand the requirements, and am starting to work out a
TOOD list of tasks required to implement the task.

I've been wanting to learn a couple new technlogies recently: diving more into
React, as well as ReactiveJS (not related to React), and Falcor (Netflix's JSON Graph).

Since I want a project to learn and test these new concepts on I think I will kill
two birds with one stone... this will slow my submision down, but given (when I asked)
there was no time restriction I think this should be ok (please forgive me otherwise).
